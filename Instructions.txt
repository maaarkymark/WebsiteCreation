The backend can be simply copied into a xampp folder. You will need to import the provided SQL file (backend_dump.sql). It was tested on PHP5.5

The frontend can also be simply copied into a xampp folder. If you want to connect to the backend directly, change the baseUrl to your local backend server in the templates/layout.html file on line 15. If you run into compatibility issues between twig & php, follow the detailed steps below:

1. Once zip file for our website is downloaded, install Twig PHP package and other dependencies using Composer. PHP, Apache and Composer are required to run the website.


2. Unzip file (if not done yet) and move folder into “htdocs” folder in “/XAMPP/xamppfiles/“ directory.


3. Open Terminal (on MAC) or Command Prompt (on Windows).


4. Copy and paste code to verify PHP version. (this info is needed for step 8):

php -v


5. Copy and paste block of code to download and install latest version of Composer. (if there’s an error, copy and paste it from this website: https://getcomposer.org/download/)

php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php') === '669656bab3166a7aff8a7506b8cb2d1c292f042046c5a994c43155c0be6190fa0355160742ab2e1c88d40d5be660b410') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"


6. Copy and paste code to move “Composer.phar” file to this folder:

sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer


7. Go into directory where “Top 5 website” folder was saved earlier:

cd …/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/“folder name”


8. Copy and paste code in your terminal to install latest version of Twig PHP package:

composer require "twig/twig:^2.0" (For PHP version 7.0.0 and up)

composer require "twig/twig:~1.0" (For PHP version 5.6.30)


9. Our website can now be viewed from your browser by typing the URL: localhost/“folder name”/“filename”


10. Enjoy our website! =)
